Table Data Gateway
It is implemented in my system in the class ConnectToDatabase that it is a gateway t
hat holds all the SQL for accessing a single table or view: selects, inserts, updates, 
and deletes.  As a benefit we are avoiding introducing SQL queries as a parameter for 
methods.




Pessimistic Offline Lock
Prevents conflicts between concurrent business transactions by allowing only one 
business transaction at a time to access data. Since I used MySQL by default at the 
end of each query a commit is applied and I only have a select statement therefore I 
think there is no need to use this architectural pattern. Pessimistic Offline Lock is 
used to work with long transactions.

Other code has been split into several pieces therefore bringing an explicit separation 
of a large method, this code becoems much more comprehensible.

The KeyBoardToFile functioality is not really a big ugly code chunk, it is in fact 
quite small, so it doesn't need that much refactoring. :)
