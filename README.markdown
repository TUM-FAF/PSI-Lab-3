# Lab 3

## 1. Code inspection

The task is to find and and apply some of the tools used for code analysis. For instance, Java developers might use Sonar to inspect their code and detect duplications, complex methods or common code smells. Try to find a similar tool and use it.
Please refrain from using *just* a static analysis tool. We need something more than that.

## 2. Refactoring

The smells, duplications or other problems that the analysis tool has identified could be easily eliminated by a set of refactoring techniques. Use the [Library](http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/) or read [The Book](http://martinfowler.com/books/#refactoring) (please read the book, thank me later) and then apply the said refactorings to your code.
Use 5-6 refactorings per team member. Show your code before and after the refactoring and provide a short description that includes the name of the refactoring and how did it benefit your code. If you're using `git`, you can write this information in the commit messages.

## 3. Architerctural patterns

Although you have learned what Design ptterns are in the IPP course, you will encounter other types of patterns, called *architectural patterns*. As opposed to the GoF ones, these describe the organization of the components within a system.

The task is to take 3-4 architectural patterns per team member from either the [Library](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/) or the [Book](http://www.martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html) (of course, the book is better, but you have PPC to attend) and apply them to your code. If they are not applicable, describe why. If the pattern would introduce *significant* changes to your code, describe what would the changes be and how will the system benefit from the said pattern.

Good luck! :metal:
